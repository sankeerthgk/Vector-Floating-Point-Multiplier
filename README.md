# Vector-Floating-Point-Multiplier

IEEE 754 format floating point numbers 

Multiplying two pairs of 32 elements with 32 bit each and storing it in a register file

top1.v is the DUT with all the pipelined stages in it and top2_tb.v is the testbench for that DUT which uses function1.v to validate the design automatically. 

DUT: top1.v

Testbench: top2_tb.v

Verification file: function1.v
